# End-to-end weakly-supervised semantic alignment

## About

This is the implementation of the paper "End-to-end weakly-supervised semantic alignment" by I. Rocco, R. ArandjeloviÄ‡ and J. Sivic. 

For more information check out the project [[website](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/weakalign/)] and the paper on [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06861)].


## Getting started

### Dependencies

The code is implemented using Python 3 and PyTorch 0.2. All dependencies are included in the standard Anaconda distribution.

### Training

The code includes scripts for pre-training the models with strong supervision (`train_strong.py`) as proposed in [our previous work](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/cnngeometric/), as well as to fine-tune the model using weak supervision (`train_weak.py`) as proposed in this work.

Training scripts can be found in the `scripts/` folder.

### Evaluation

Evaluation is implemented in the `eval.py` file. It can evaluate a single affine or TPS model (with the `--model-aff` and `--model-tps` parameters respectively), or a combined affine+TPS model (with the `--model`) parameter.

The evaluation dataset is passed with the `--eval-dataset` parameter.

### Trained models

Trained models for the baseline method using only strong supervision and the proposed method using additional weak supervision are provided below. You can store them in the `trained_models/` folder. 

With the provided code below you should obtain the results from Table 2 of the paper.
